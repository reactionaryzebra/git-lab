1) git init
2) git add filename
3) git commit -m "message"

1) git pull
2) git reset filename
3) git reset commitname
4) The double dashes reduces any ambiguity in case the branch and file name are the same, and in case the file name begins with a single dash.
5) If you make errors that break the code, or want to merge changes that someone else has made instead of using any changes you have made, you may want to revert back to a previous commit.
